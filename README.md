For this lab, the geographic area that I wanted to examine was of Seattle, Washington. There are 4 tilesets included in this webmap, which are the dark monochrome Mapbox basemap, a layer which includes the traffic detectors in Seattle, a layer which includes both the basemap layer and the traffic detectors, and lastly, a UW themed map layer. As for zoom control of each layer, each layer uses the same inimum zoom level of 9, and a maximum zoom layer of 14. The data of traffic detectors is provided by Seattle Geo Data.

Below are screenshots of each layer
